2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript ?


 ANS:

	* Objects in JavaScript are like magical containers that hold information in key-value pairs,
	  allowing us to organize and access data easily.
	* Internally, objects are represented as collections of properties and methods. 
	* They can contain other objects nested within them, creating a hierarchy of data. 	
	* Accessing and modifying object properties is done through dot notation or square brackets.
